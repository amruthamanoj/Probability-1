'''
Assume that we have a set A with n elements. Any selection of r objects from A, where each object can be selected more than 
once, is called a combination of n objects taken r at a time with repetition.

#A bakery boasts eight varieties of doughnuts. If a box of doughnuts contains one dozen, 
#how many different options are there for a box of doughnuts?

l = a.tolist()
r = 12  # how many doughnuts we need in one box, r>k

#duplicates of any of the 8 available
